# Random Joke App

Random Joke App is a simple Android application that fetches and displays random jokes.

## Features

- **Kotlin**: Main programming language for the app.  
- **Retrofit**: For handling API requests.  
- **Gson**: For parsing JSON responses.  
- **Material Design Components**: For creating a modern and user-friendly UI.  
- **Official Joke API**: Source of random jokes.  

## How It Works

1. The app uses [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make API requests.
2. A random joke is fetched from the [Official Joke API](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke).
3. The joke is displayed on the screen in a simple and engaging format.
